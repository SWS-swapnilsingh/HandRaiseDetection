# Hand Raise Detection Project'

In this project, I have used the YOLOv8 pose detection model to detect whether the person standing in front of the camera has raised his hands. If the coordinates of the shoulder are below the coordinates of the elbow then it will say "Hand is raised" otherwise "Hand is not raised"
